.SH DESCRIPTION
The favorites.addItems service function adds an artefact to the user-based favorite section.

.nf
.B Suffixes
.fi
"albums", "tracks", "videos", "artists", "playlists", "mixes"

A unique feature of \fBlibopenTIDAL\fP(3) is the ability to add multiple artefacts of the same type.
This is done by creating an array of artefacts and parsing it to the correct parameter.

The ArtifactNotFound parameter alters the behaviour of the TIDAL API, not finding the artefact.
When adding an array of artefacts, one might choose to skip the missing artefact ("SKIP")
instead of giving up ("FAIL").

.nf
.B Thread Handle
.fi
You must never share the same handle in multiple threads. You can pass the handles around among threads, but you must never use a single handle from more than one thread at any given time.

Call \fIhttp(3)\fP to get the session main handle.
.SH RETURN VALUE
See \fIenums.status(7)\fP.
